## ðŸ“– About 
The Sportradar Live Football World Cup Scoreboard is a library for dotnet programs, which gives access to all the ongoing matches and their scores.

## ðŸš€ Usage
Start a new match:
```C#
```

Update a score:
```C#
```

Finish a match:
```C#
```

Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score:
```C#
```

## ðŸ’¡ Assumptions
* The only constraint on score updates is that new scores must be positive numbers. There are no requirements on how often a match is updated, so a new score could be less than the current one, for example if a goal has been disallowed.
